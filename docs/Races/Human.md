**_Age_**. Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

**_Alignment_**. Humans tend toward no particular alignment. The best and the worst are found among them.

**_Size_**. Humans vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

**_Speed_**. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

**_Languages_**. You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice. Humans typically learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, including obscure dialects.
