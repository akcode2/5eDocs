# What is this?

This is a web version of the 5E System Reference Document. The SRD contains everything you need to play that table-top roleplaying game you're thinking of. The officially published document is a huge, unwiedly document. I wanted to make something that would be easier to reference and search.

The System Reference Document contains the minimum information you need to play, but there are many expansions that build on top of it. You can find resources online that include those expansions, for example, [5etools]. Still, I hope you find this useful!

This site was made with [Jekyll], a static site generator, and uses the [Just the Docs] template for Jekyll.
